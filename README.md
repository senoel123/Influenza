# Influenza Season
---

The goal of this analysis is to help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help
plan for the influenza season when additional staff is in high demand. The results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to plan for staffing needs
across the country proactively.

**Objectives**

Determine when to send staff and how many to each state.

---
**Scope** 

The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

---
**Motivation**

The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to treat these extra patients adequately. The medical staffing agency provides this
temporary staff.
